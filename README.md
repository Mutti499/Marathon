# Marathon 🏃🏃🏃

  A philosopher once said, "Some flowers... Some flowers don’t grow in some soils. Such is life." 
A few days ago, I received such an e-mail from rambo.ocon@boun.edu.tr. He wrote in that e-mail, "As a traveling race man, I could not do anything when it came to coding. I’m not good 
enough to code and need help from Mustafa." So he asked me to create this project for me to 
help him. And now it’s time to help!👨‍💻

  Esteban Ocon, a famous Formula 1 pilot, also known as Rambo Ocon, decides to participate 
in the 43rd Istanbul marathon, even though he has no previous running experience. Since he has 
a competitive personality, he wants to finish the race in first place. So he decides to cheat and 
complete the course in the shortest way possible. 🏅

  In the meantime, he sees that at some points on the path, the opposing team’s flags fly 
around. He wants to take down all these flags before the race starts. Because he doesn’t want to 
get tired before the race, he wants to do it in the shortest possible way. Also, this will mean that 
the chances of him getting caught by the police will decrease; hence he will make it to the race. 🚩

  Before the race, Rambo Ocon takes the map of Istanbul in front of him, marks the points 
where the flags are, and starts calculating the shortest route. Since there are many streets in 
Istanbul, and he is bad at math, he cannot calculate it. Besides, he doesn’t know how to code, 
which is the icing on the cake. It’s time to help Rambo! 🗺️
